The `crossword-react-app` is a React-based web application for playing crosswords. It's bootstrapped with Create React App, indicating a standard React development setup.

Here's a detailed summary:

**1. Project Setup and Dependencies:**
*   **`package.json` and `package-lock.json`**: Defines the project as `crossword-react-app` version `0.1.0`. Key dependencies include:
    *   `react` and `react-dom` (version `19.1.1`): Core React libraries.
    *   `react-scripts` (version `5.0.1`): Provides scripts for starting, building, testing, and ejecting the application (from Create React App).
    *   `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event`, `@testing-library/dom`: Libraries for testing React components.
    *   `web-vitals`: For measuring web performance.
*   **Scripts**: Standard Create React App scripts are available:
    *   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
    *   `npm build`: Builds the app for production.
    *   `npm test`: Launches the test runner.
    *   `npm eject`: Ejects the project from `react-scripts` (a one-way operation for advanced configuration).
*   **`.gitignore`**: Configured to ignore common development artifacts like `node_modules`, `coverage`, `build` directory, and local environment files.
*   **`README.md`**: Provides basic instructions on how to get started with the project, run scripts, and links to Create React App documentation.

**2. Application Structure and Flow:**
*   **Entry Point (`src/index.js`)**: Renders the main `App` component into the `root` div of `public/index.html`.
*   **Main Application Logic (`src/App.js`)**: Manages the primary application state, switching between a `PuzzleSelector` component and a `CrosswordGame` component based on whether a puzzle has been selected.
*   **Styling (`src/Crossword.css`)**: Contains comprehensive CSS rules for the entire application, including general body/app container styles, level selection, grid layout, cell appearance (active, highlighted, correct, incorrect states), clue sections, and the win modal. It uses CSS variables (`--grid-size`) for dynamic grid sizing.

**3. Core Components:**
*   **`PuzzleSelector.js`**:
    *   Fetches a list of available puzzles from `public/puzzles.json`.
    *   Displays buttons for each puzzle, showing its title and difficulty.
    *   When a puzzle is selected, it passes the puzzle's file path (e.g., `puzzles/easy_1.json`) to the `App` component via the `onSelectPuzzle` prop.
*   **`CrosswordGame.js`**:
    *   The central component for playing the crossword.
    *   **State Management**: Manages `puzzleData`, `userAnswers`, `validationState`, `activeCellIndex`, `currentDirection` (across/down), and `showWinModal`.
    *   **Data Loading**: Fetches the selected puzzle's JSON data (e.g., `easy_1.json`) using `fetch`.
    *   **Solution Generation**: Contains helper functions (`generateSolution`, `buildClueMappings`) to process the raw puzzle data into a usable solution array and mappings between cells and clues.
    *   **User Interaction**: 
        *   `handleCellChange`: Updates `userAnswers` when a user types in a cell.
        *   `handleCellFocus`: Sets the `activeCellIndex` and attempts to determine the `currentDirection` (across/down) based on available clues for the focused cell.
        *   `handleCellKeyDown`: Handles keyboard navigation (arrow keys, backspace, spacebar to toggle direction) and input.
        *   `handleClueClick`: Sets the `currentDirection` and `activeCellIndex` based on the clicked clue.
    *   **Puzzle Checking**: `checkPuzzle` function compares `userAnswers` with the `solution` and updates `validationState` for each cell (correct/incorrect). If all answers are correct, it shows the `WinModal`.
    *   **Rendering**: Renders the `Grid` and `Clues` components, passing necessary props. It also conditionally renders the `WinModal`.
*   **`Grid.js`**:
    *   Receives `gridSpec`, `size`, `userAnswers`, `validationState`, `activeCellIndex`, `highlightedCells`, and event handlers as props.
    *   Dynamically sets the CSS variable `--grid-size` for grid layout.
    *   Maps over `gridSpec` to render individual `Cell` components.
*   **`Cell.js`**:
    *   Represents a single cell in the crossword grid.
    *   Displays the cell number (if any) and an input field for user entry (unless it's a black cell).
    *   Applies CSS classes based on its state (`black`, `active`, `highlighted`, `correct`, `incorrect`).
    *   Handles `onFocus`, `onChange`, and `onKeyDown` events, passing them up to the `CrosswordGame` component.
*   **`Clues.js`**:
    *   Displays a list of clues (either "across" or "down").
    *   Highlights the active clue based on `activeClueNumber`.
    *   Handles `onClueClick` events, passing the clue type and number back to `CrosswordGame`.
*   **`WinModal.js`**:
    *   A simple modal component displayed when the puzzle is successfully completed.
    *   Provides a "Play Again" button that triggers the `onClose` callback.

**4. Puzzle Data Structure (`public/puzzles.json`, `public/puzzles/*.json`)**:
*   `public/puzzles.json`: A manifest file listing available puzzles, their `id`, `title`, `difficulty`, and the `file` path to their detailed JSON data.
*   `public/puzzles/easy_1.json` and `medium_1.json`: Examples of individual puzzle data files. Each contains:
    *   `size`: The dimension of the square grid (e.g., 5 for a 5x5 grid).
    *   `gridSpec`: An array of objects defining each cell's properties (x, y coordinates, optional `number` for clue start, and implicit `black` property if not present).
    *   `clues`: An object containing `across` and `down` arrays. Each clue object has:
        *   `number`: The clue number.
        *   `text`: The clue text.
        *   `answer`: The correct answer.
        *   `x`, `y`: Starting coordinates of the answer on the grid.
        *   `len`: Length of the answer.

**5. Testing and Performance:**
*   **`src/App.test.js`**: A basic test file generated by Create React App, testing if a "learn react" link is rendered.
*   **`src/setupTests.js`**: Configures `jest-dom` for custom Jest matchers, enhancing DOM testing capabilities.
*   **`src/reportWebVitals.js`**: Integrates `web-vitals` to report performance metrics like CLS, FID, FCP, LCP, and TTFB.

In summary, `crossword-react-app` is a well-structured React application that provides a functional crossword game experience. It separates concerns into logical components, manages game state effectively, and loads puzzle data from JSON files, making it extensible for adding new puzzles.
