🎯 Core Layout (Responsive, Mobile-first)

Header (sticky, 56–64px):

Left: Game title/logo.

Right: Timer + Difficulty dropdown (Easy / Medium / Hard).

Main Content Split

Desktop (≥768px): Two-column layout.

Left: Crossword grid + inline status bar (row/col, clue number, error state).

Right: Clue panel with tabs (Across/Down), search bar, and scrolling list of clues.

Mobile (<768px): Stack vertically (grid first, clues below).

Footer Actions (sticky)

Primary button: Check Puzzle (accent).

Secondary: Check Word.

Tertiary: Hint (x).

Ghost button: Reset.

Always visible → prevents scroll tax.

Empty state UX:

If no cell selected: show message → “Select a cell to start—promise I don’t bite.”

🧠 Information Architecture Upgrades

Single source of truth for selection state → grid, clue, and status bar are always in sync.

Grid <-> Clue deep linking:

Click clue = focus first empty cell + scroll grid.

Click cell = highlight corresponding clue.

Mode toggle: Spacebar/Tab switches Across ↔ Down. Status bar shows current direction.

Difficulty decoupled from grid size:

Easy → generous hints, auto-validation.

Medium → limited hints, word-level check.

Hard → only final validation, vague error nudges.

🎨 Visual Design System

Typography scale:

H1: 28px, H2: 20px, Body: 16px, Small: 14px.

Grid letters → monospace font.

Spacing system: 8pt scale (grid gutter 4–6px, clue list padding 8–12px).

Color tokens (light mode):

--ink: #222

--muted: #6b7280

--bg: #fff

--panel: #f8fafc

--accent: #3b82f6 (selection)

--warn: #ef4444 (error)

--ok: #10b981 (correct)

States:

Selected word → soft accent background.

Current cell → bold border.

Error flash → 300ms subtle animation (not anxiety-inducing).

⌨️ Interaction Model

Keyboard-first controls:

Type letters → auto-advance.

Backspace → delete & reverse.

Arrow keys → move cell.

Spacebar → toggle Across/Down.

Enter → jump to next clue.

Validation modes:

Soft validate on demand (word check).

Hard validate only on “Check Puzzle”.

No constant red spam.

Hints scaling with difficulty:

Easy → unlimited letter reveal.

Medium → limited letter reveal, word check only.

Hard → no reveal, vague “This looks off” hints.

♿ Accessibility (non-negotiable)

ARIA roles:

Grid → role="grid" with row/col counts.

Cells → role="gridcell", with aria-selected, aria-labelledby linking to active clue.

Screen reader UX:

Focused cell announces: “Row 3, Col 5, Across 14, 5 letters, letter 2.”

Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1.

Dark mode: honor prefers-color-scheme.

Reduced motion: respect prefers-reduced-motion.

📑 Clue Panel UX

Tabs: Across | Down (with counts, e.g. “Across (10)”).

Filter: Live-search box for clues.

Clue formatting: Show number, clue text, and length (5).

Progress chips:

✅ solved, ✳ partially filled, ○ untouched.
