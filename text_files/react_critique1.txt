  Here is my critique of the description.txt file:

  This is a good list of desired features for the
  crossword game. Here's a breakdown of your points based
  on the current state of the application:

   1. "button to go back to start"
       * Critique: This is an excellent suggestion. The
         application is currently missing a way to return to
         the puzzle selection screen without reloading the
         entire page.
       * Recommendation: I can add a "Back to Puzzles"
         button on the game screen. This would improve
         navigation and user experience.

   2. "check puzzle, check word, hint in a same row"
       * Critique: This is already implemented in the
         current design. The "Check Puzzle," "Check Word,"
         and "Hint" buttons are positioned in a single row
         below the crossword grid.
       * Recommendation: No action is needed for this point,
         as it's already in place.

   3. "across and down to be beside i.e grid, across and down
      would be three columns"
       * Critique: This is a great idea for improving the
         layout on larger screens. The current layout is a
         two-column design where the grid is in the first
         column, and the "Across" and "Down" clues are stacked
         vertically in the second. A three-column layout
         (Across clues | Grid | Down clues) is a more
         traditional and often more user-friendly arrangement
         for crossword puzzles.
       * Recommendation: I can modify the application's CSS to
         implement a three-column layout. This would involve
         changing the grid structure of the main game
         container.
