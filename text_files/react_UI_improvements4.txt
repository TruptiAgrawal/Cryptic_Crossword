  UI/UX Improvement Plan for Crossword Application

  Executive Summary
  This document outlines three key improvements for the
  crossword application's user interface. The highest
  priority is fixing a critical navigation flaw by adding
  a "back" button. The second is to modernize the game
  screen by implementing a standard, responsive
  three-column layout. The third point confirms that the
  existing action-button layout is effective and requires
  no work. Implementing these changes will significantly
  enhance the user experience and align the application
  with modern web standards.

  Prioritized Action Plan

  ##### 1. Implement Back-Button Navigation (Priority:
  High)

   * Problem: Users are trapped in the game view and cannot
     easily return to the puzzle selection screen. Forcing a
     full-page reload to navigate is unintuitive,
     inefficient, and creates a poor user experience.
   * Solution: Add a button component, clearly labeled "Back
     to Puzzles," to a prominent and consistent location on
     the game screen (e.g., the top-left corner). This
     provides a simple and predictable way for users to
     navigate the application.

  ##### 2. Redesign Game Screen Layout (Priority: Medium)

   * Problem: The current two-column layout for the clues
     and grid is not optimal for puzzle-solving, especially
     on larger screens. It requires excessive scrolling and
     disjointed eye movement.
   * Solution:
       * Refactor the game screen's CSS to use a
         three-column grid layout (Across Clues | Grid |
         Down Clues). This is the standard, most
         user-friendly layout for digital crosswords.
       * Ensure the new layout is responsive. Use CSS media
         queries to make the layout adapt to smaller
         screens. On mobile devices, the layout should
         collapse gracefully into a single-column or tabbed
         view to maintain readability and usability.

  ##### 3. Verify Action Button Layout (Priority:
  Informational)

   * Finding: The current horizontal layout for the "check
     puzzle," "check word," and "hint" buttons is
     well-organized and effective.
   * Action: No development work is required for this
     feature.

  Development Checklist

   1. Task: Create a "Back to Puzzles" button component and
      add it to the main game view.
   2. Task: Refactor the primary game view stylesheet to use
      CSS Grid, creating three columns for the "Across"
      clues, the grid, and the "Down" clues.
   3. Task: Add media queries to the game view stylesheet to
      handle screen sizes below a certain threshold (e.g.,
      768px), collapsing the layout into a usable
      single-column format.

  Future Considerations

  Once the above tasks are complete, the team could consider
  these additional enhancements for future development
  cycles:

   * Keyboard Navigation: Allow users to navigate the grid
     and enter letters using only the arrow and letter keys.
   * Accessibility (A11y): Add ARIA attributes to the grid
     and controls to improve screen reader support.
   * Save Progress: Implement functionality to automatically
     save the user's progress in a puzzle so they can return
     to it later.
