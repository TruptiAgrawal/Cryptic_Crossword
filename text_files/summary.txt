Based on the `README.md`, here is a summary and critique of the game logic.

### Summary of Game Logic

The project is a web-based cryptic crossword game designed to onboard new players and challenge experienced ones. The core logic revolves around:

*   **Gradual Progression:** Players start with "Easy" puzzles that teach them fundamental cryptic clue patterns (like anagrams and hidden words) with tutorials. They then advance to "Medium" and "Hard" levels, which introduce more complex and abstract wordplay.
*   **Interactive Gameplay:** Users interact with a standard crossword grid. Clicking a clue highlights the corresponding grid spaces, where they can type their answers.
*   **Hint System:** To assist players, the game offers several hints: revealing a single letter, checking if a submitted word is correct, and, for easy puzzles, providing a detailed explanation of the clue's logic.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Through optional user accounts, players can save their progress, track statistics (like solve time and accuracy), and maintain a daily solving streak.
*   **Content:** The puzzles are manually created to ensure high quality and a consistent learning curve, primarily using 15x15 grids.

### Critique of the Game Logic

The concept is strong, especially the educational focus, which addresses the high barrier to entry for cryptic crosswords. However, there are several areas that could present challenges or be refined:

1.  **Content Scalability:** The reliance on manually created puzzles is a double-edged sword. While it ensures quality, it's also a significant bottleneck. The project's long-term success depends on a continuous stream of new puzzles, which is labor-intensive to produce. The game could quickly run out of content, frustrating engaged users.
2.  **Subjective Difficulty:** The "Easy, Medium, Hard" progression is clear, but difficulty can be subjective. A player might be skilled at anagrams but new to other clue types, making a puzzle's difficulty inconsistent for them. A more flexible system, perhaps tagging clues by type (e.g., "anagram," "homophone") and allowing players to practice specific patterns, could be more effective.
3.  **Hint System Limitations:** Limiting the "Explain Clue" feature to easy puzzles is a good way to encourage learning, but it may create a frustrating difficulty spike at the medium level. Consider offering a "costlier" or less-detailed explanation for medium clues to avoid players getting permanently stuck and abandoning the game.
4.  **Engagement Loop:** While streaks and stats are good, the core engagement loop relies heavily on the quality and availability of new puzzles. Without a strong content pipeline, features like daily streaks become unsustainable. The design should account for what happens when a user completes all available puzzles.

### Technical Implementation Summary of `cryptic_crossword.html`

This HTML file creates a self-contained, interactive cryptic crossword game that runs entirely in the browser without any external dependencies.

**HTML Structure**

The HTML document is well-structured and semantic, creating the skeleton for the application.

*   **`<head>`:**
    *   Contains standard metadata (`charset`, `viewport`).
    *   The `<title>` is set to "Cryptic Crossword".
    *   A `<style>` tag encapsulates all the CSS, meaning there are no external stylesheet requests.

*   **`<body>`:**
    *   The body uses `display: flex` to create a side-by-side layout for the game and the clues.
    *   **`<div id="game-container">`**: This is the primary container for the interactive part of the game.
        *   `<h1>Cryptic Crossword</h1>`: The main title of the page.
        *   `<div id="grid-container"></div>`: An empty container that serves as the parent for the dynamically generated crossword grid cells.
        *   `<button id="check-button">Check Puzzle</button>`: The button that triggers the answer validation logic.
    *   **`<div id="clues-container">`**: This container holds the clue lists.
        *   It's a flex container itself, arranging the "Across" and "Down" lists next to each other.
        *   **`<div class="clue-list">`**: Two of these divs exist, one for each clue direction.
            *   `<h3>Across</h3>` and `<h3>Down</h3>`: Headings for the clue lists.
            *   `<ul id="across-clues"></ul>` and `<ul id="down-clues"></ul>`: Empty unordered lists that will be populated with the clues by the JavaScript.

**CSS Styling**

The CSS is defined within the `<head>` and is responsible for the entire visual presentation.

*   **Layout:**
    *   The main `body` is a flex container (`display: flex`, `justify-content: center`) which centers the main content horizontally.
    *   The crossword grid itself (`#grid-container`) uses CSS Grid (`display: grid`) to create the 5x5 structure. `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` are set to `repeat(5, 50px)`, creating a perfectly uniform grid.

*   **Grid and Cells:**
    *   `.grid-cell`: Defines the look of each cell in the grid (size, background color).
    *   `.grid-cell.black`: Overrides the default cell style for non-playable squares, giving them a black background.
    *   `.grid-cell .number`: A `<span>` for the clue number is positioned absolutely in the top-left corner of its parent cell, making it appear like a traditional crossword.
    *   `.grid-cell input`: The text input fields are styled to be transparent and borderless, appearing as if the user is typing directly into the cell itself. The `:focus` pseudo-class provides a subtle background color change for better UX.

*   **Interactivity and Feedback Styles:**
    *   `.clue-list li.active`: When a clue is selected, its corresponding list item gets a light blue background.
    *   `.grid-cell.highlighted input`: The input fields of the selected clue are also highlighted with the same light blue background, visually linking the clue to the grid.
    *   `.correct` & `.incorrect`: These classes are applied after the user clicks "Check Puzzle". They change the background color of the input fields to green for correct answers and red for incorrect ones, providing clear feedback.

**JavaScript Logic**

The script, enclosed in `<script>` tags at the end of the body, brings the game to life. It runs after the entire HTML document has been parsed (`DOMContentLoaded`).

*   **`puzzleData` Object:** This is the heart of the game, acting as a database.
    *   `size`: Defines the grid dimensions (5x5).
    *   `gridSpec`: An array of objects, where each object defines a cell. It specifies the cell's coordinates (`x`, `y`) and if it contains a clue `number`.
    *   `clues`: An object containing two arrays, `across` and `down`. Each item in these arrays is an object describing a single clue: its `number`, `text` (the clue itself), the `answer`, its starting coordinates (`x`, `y`), and its `len` (length).
    *   `solution`: Crucially, this array is **programmatically generated**. The script iterates through the `across` clues and their answers to build a complete solution map of the grid. This is an efficient way to ensure the answers and the grid are perfectly synchronized without having to define the solution manually.

*   **Data Mapping for Interactivity:**
    *   To easily link clues to cells, the script creates two mapping objects:
        *   `cellClueMapping`: An object where keys are cell indices (0-24). The value for each key is an object indicating which `across` and/or `down` clue passes through it. This is used to highlight clues when a cell is clicked.
        *   `clueCellMapping`: An object that maps a clue ID (e.g., `across1`) to an array of the cell indices it occupies. This is used to highlight all the cells of a clue when the clue is clicked in the list.

*   **Dynamic Rendering:**
    *   **Grid:** The script iterates through `puzzleData.gridSpec`. For each item, it creates a `div` (`.grid-cell`), an `<input>` field (unless it's a black cell), and a `<span>` for the clue number if one exists. These are then appended to the `#grid-container`.
    *   **Clues:** The `renderClues` function iterates through the `across` and `down` clue arrays. For each clue, it creates an `<li>` element with the clue text and attaches a `click` event listener to it.

*   **Event Handling:**
    *   **Clue Clicks:** The listener on each clue `<li>` calls `highlightClue` and focuses the first input of that clue in the grid.
    *   **Grid Focus (`focusin`):** When an input field gains focus, it calls `highlightCurrentClues` to highlight the relevant clue(s) in the side lists.
    *   **Keyboard Input (`keyup`):** This is the most complex event handler. It listens for:
        *   **Arrow Keys:** To move the focus between adjacent cells.
        *   **Backspace:** To clear the current cell's value and move focus to the previous cell.
        *   **Letters:** After a letter is typed, it automatically moves focus to the next cell in the word, allowing for fluid entry.
    *   **Check Button Click:** This listener iterates through every input on the grid, compares its value to the `solution` array, and applies the `.correct` or `.incorrect` class accordingly. It then checks if all inputs are correct and displays a success alert if the puzzle is solved.
